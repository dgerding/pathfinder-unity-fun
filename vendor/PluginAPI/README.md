These header files were taken from the `Unity\Editor\Data\PluginAPI` directory
of Unity 2019.1.0f2. They're included here purely for reference purposes,
and aren't actually used by the code at all.

For example code that uses these header files, see the
[Native code (C++) rendering plugin example for Unity][example].
